# Checking Existing Uecases And What to Build

As this is an ongoing development, we would like you guys to look up if someone is working on the usecase or if it's already built.

You can use Postman or Any other API Client to get data. We are using Postman to make a GET request to this URL [https://easy-search-backend.herokuapp.com/usecases/popularApps](https://easy-search-backend.herokuapp.com/usecases/popularApps).

As Dumb Charades is already built, we can build the Age Calculator.&#x20;
