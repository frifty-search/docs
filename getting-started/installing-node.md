# Installing Node

Node.js is written in C, C++, and JavaScript, and it is built on the open-source [V8](https://developers.google.com/v8/) JavaScript engine which also powers JS in browsers such as Google Chrome. As V8 supports new features in JavaScript, they are incorporated into Node.\
\
For Frifty, We are using Node's Latest Version i.e. V16 and React V17. We will update0 the package when they will release new packages.

## Installing using NVM

If you are using node for multiple projects use NVM. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.

\
Read the installation guide present in the [link](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating). \
